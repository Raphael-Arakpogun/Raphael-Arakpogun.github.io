    <h2>Lab Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This lab demonstrates my ability to configure and verify static routing across multiple devices in Cisco Packet Tracer.
      I also reviewed CDP neighbor discovery and practiced backing up device configurations to a TFTP server.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Cisco Packet Tracer</li>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Achieve full end-to-end connectivity across multiple routed networks and confirm service reachability.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Topics:</strong> Static routing, CDP verification, and TFTP configuration backup.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What I Built / Configured</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Configured interfaces (Layer 3 addressing where required)</li>
      <li>Verified directly connected connectivity before routing changes</li>
      <li>Created static routes to reach multiple remote networks</li>
      <li>Used CDP to confirm neighbor relationships and correct physical connections</li>
      <li>Copied running configurations to a TFTP server for backup</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Evidence</h2>

  <p>
    Below is a screenshot of the Packet Tracer topology used for static routing,
    CDP neighbor checks, and TFTP backups.

    <h2>Testing and Verification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interface status:</strong> Confirmed key links were up and correctly addressed.</li>
      <li><strong>Ping testing:</strong> Verified pings between directly connected devices first, then across routed networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Path checks:</strong> Used traceroute to confirm traffic followed the expected route.</li>
      <li><strong>Service checks:</strong> Confirmed reachability to remote servers (example: TFTP server ping success).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Troubleshooting Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Issue:</strong> A connectivity test failed after initial routing configuration.</li>
      <li><strong>Checks performed:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Re-checked IP address and subnet mask correctness</li>
          <li>Verified next-hop addresses for static routes</li>
          <li>Confirmed interfaces were not shutdown</li>
          <li>Used CDP to verify neighbor connections were correct</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Corrected the addressing/routing mismatch and re-tested until end-to-end pings succeeded.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Static routing (next-hop routing)</li>
      <li>Subnet awareness and IP planning</li>
      <li>CDP neighbor discovery and validation</li>
      <li>Connectivity testing (ping/traceroute)</li>
      <li>Configuration backup to a TFTP server</li>
      <li>Structured troubleshooting workflow</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why static routes must use the correct next-hop (especially on Ethernet networks)</li>
      <li>How CDP helps confirm device-to-device connections quickly</li>
      <li>How to confirm routing success using traceroute, not only ping</li>
      <li>The value of backing up configs to TFTP after successful verification</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Next Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      Next, I plan to extend this design by adding VLANs and inter-VLAN routing, then validating access rules (ACLs) between networks.
